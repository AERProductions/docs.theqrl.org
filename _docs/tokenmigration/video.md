<div markdown="1">
Once you have a QRL Address of your own, you can open the [Token Migration App](https://migration.theqrl.org). 

1. Paste in the QRL address generated in *Part 1*. 
2. Optionally, enter an email address into the next field if you want to receive periodic updates when tokens are staged for being swapped at Genesis. 
3. Click “Submit” to get **Ethereum Burn Address**. Save this address for Part 3.

Each QRL ERC20 token sent to this address will be credited in a 1:1 ratio with QRL coins (Quanta) to the QRL Wallet address you entered on MainNet launch.

> If you should lose, forget, or for whatever reason need to re-generate your QRL ERC20 Burn Address, re-enter your QRL Wallet address into the token migration app.
