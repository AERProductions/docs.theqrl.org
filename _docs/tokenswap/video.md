## Part 1 - Create a Wallet
{:data-time="0"}
{:data-video="JXXJIVI3Oeo"}

<div markdown="1">
Make a new QRL address on the **Main QRL Network** (not the test network) the **Web Wallet** using your web browser. See the <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org" target="_blank">QRL Web Wallet</a> to get started.

> Make certain your private key is valid and will open the wallet. It is your responsibility to verify your wallet backup method works *BEFORE* transferring any QRL to the address. Simply open the wallet using your backup method to verify the key is correct. Compare the wallet address shown in the web wallet you just opened with the address you created before.
{: .warning}

Once you have a valid and verified QRL wallet generated via one of the above steps, continue on to Step 2 
</div>


## Part 2 - Go to token migration page
{:data-time="30"}
{:data-video="JXXJIVI3Oeo"}

<div markdown="1">
Once you have a QRL Address of your own, you can open the [Token Migration App.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0). 

1. Paste in the QRL address generated in *Step 1*. 
2. Enter an email address into the next field if you want to receive updates when tokens are swapped. All QRL ERC20 Burn Addresses are monitored and emails will be sent periodically when new transactions are detected to confirm QRL MainNet Wallet balance.
3. Click “Submit” and an Ethereum Burn address will be generated and displayed to you:

Each QRL ERC20 token sent to this address will be credited in a 1:1 ratio with QRL coins (Quanta) credited to the QRL Wallet address you entered on MainNet launch.

> If you should lose, forget, or for whatever reason need to re-generate your QRL ERC20 Burn Address, re-enter your QRL Wallet address into the token migration app.

## Part 3 - Burn
{:data-time="100"}
{:data-video="JXXJIVI3Oeo"}

<div markdown="1">
Every time you send your QRL ERC20 tokens from anywhere (exchange, myetherwallet, etc.) to the burn address, your QRL wallet balance will be updated. If you entered an email address, you will receive a confirmation message.
</div>


> Funds will not be recoverable if you lose the mnemonic or hex seed of the QRL wallet. You are the bank.
